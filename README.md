Currently, a Smart Contract Auditor at Oak Security/Solidified since January 2023, conducting code reviews publicly accessible through provided links. Also, an EVM & Security Researcher at Turing Consulting since July 2023, responsible for protocol optimization, low-level assembly auditing (Yul, sometimes Huff), and providing security consultancy for the Unlockd Protocol. Secured two AAVE grants for contributions to fortifying AAVE v3-token and AAVE Starknet bridge. Additionally, skilled in zk circom circuits, audited them, and a zkyAcademy block 1 fellow with experience in auditing cryptographic primitives libraries.

##Â Bug Bounties

| Date       |   July 2022  |  
|------------|-----------------|	
| Protocol name and type | [HIGH] AAVE v3 token, DeFi Lending and Borrowing |
| Link | https://x.com/vn_martinez_/status/1683505277818003458?s=20  |
| Reflection | Found a high severity issue on the AAVE token, which was later fixed by the AAVE team. "Wrong parameter order on delegations". This was the first high severity on a live / ready to deploy protocol I have ever found. Working with the certora team was a great experience.|

| Date       |   October 2023  |  
|------------|-----------------|	
| Protocol name and type | [HIGH] RAI (debt auctions bug), non-pegged stable-coin |
| Link | https://mirror.xyz/vnmrtz.eth/WXm4QJFInoB992czPniFbQyAkGUkdoaSd5zEjK5uRIo  |
| Reflection | Discovered a high severity bug latent in the RAI stablecoin protocol. This flaw led to an unintended overinflation of the protocol token, and notably, it was introduced following a recommendation from OpenZeppelin. |

| Date       |   November 2023  |  
|------------|-----------------|	
| Protocol name and type | [HIGH]  TAI (debt auctions bug), stablecoin |
| Link | Private, https://tai.money/  |
| Reflection | Given that TAI is a fork of RAI, I ensured that the identified bug in the RAI protocol was also addressed in the TAI protocol. |

| Date       |   December 2023  |  
|------------|-----------------|	
| Protocol name and type | [CRITICAL] RAI (liquidations DOS, GEB framework zero day), non-pegged stable-coin  |
| Link | https://x.com/vn_martinez_/status/1733242624117477790?s=20  |
| Reflection | Discovered a critical severity bug latent in the GEB framework of the RAI stablecoin. This flaw led to a SAFE being able to avoid liquidations between a debt threshold. In tandem with the team at defi wonderland, who fowarded the issue to RAI, the RAI team managed to fix the issue on their ungoverned protocol. This has been the most significant bug I have ever found, securing +33M  of TVL at risk. |
