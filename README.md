# Smart Contract Audits
This repo includes a list of most Smart Contract audits that I have done since getting into Web3 offensive security in 2021.

Disclaimer: all Oak Security audits are performed in teams of three (that's why they are so good!). Therefore, authorship of both findings and report are shared with two additional auditors.


## Solidity


## Formal Verification


## Public disclosed bugs
